                            <p>
                            <h2>Instructions</h2>
                            1.	Make the Bolognese Sauce: Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the onion, carrots, celery, and garlic and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the ground beef and pork and cook until browned. Drain off any excess grease. <br>
                            2.	Deglaze the pot with the red wine, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pot. Add the crushed tomatoes, beef broth, oregano, basil, salt, and pepper. Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, for at least 1 hour, or up to 4 hours. <br>
                            3.	Make the Béchamel Sauce: Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in the flour and cook for 1 minute, whisking constantly. Gradually whisk in the milk, salt, and pepper. Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until thickened, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in the Parmesan cheese. <br>
                            4.	Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). <br>
                            5.	Assemble the lasagna: Spread a thin layer of Bolognese sauce on the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Top with a layer of lasagna noodles. Spread a thin layer of Béchamel sauce over the noodles, then sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and mozzarella cheese. Repeat the layers, ending with a layer of sauce and cheese. <br>
                            6.	Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake for 30 minutes. Uncover and bake for 30 minutes more, or until the lasagna is bubbly and the cheese is melted and golden brown. <br>
                            7.	Let stand for 10 minutes before serving. <br>

                            STEPS<br>
                            1.	Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the linguine according to package directions until al dente.
                            2.	While the pasta is cooking, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the pancetta or guanciale and cook until crispy, about 5 minutes.
                            3.	In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs, Pecorino Romano cheese, Parmesan cheese, and black pepper.
                            4.	Drain the pasta and reserve 1 cup of the pasta water.
                            5.	Add the pasta to the skillet with the pancetta or guanciale and toss to coat.
                            6.	Pour the egg mixture over the pasta and toss quickly until the sauce is thickened and coats the pasta.
                            7.	If the sauce is too dry, add a little of the reserved pasta water.
                            8.	Stir in the parsley and serve immediately.

                                •	2 tablespoons olive oil <br>
                                •	1 tablespoon lemon juice <br>
                                •	1 teaspoon dried oregano <br>
                                •	1/2 teaspoon salt <br>
                                •	1/4 teaspoon black pepper <br>

                            <h2>Instructions</h2>
                            1.	Prepare the marinade: In a medium bowl, whisk together the olive oil, lemon juice, oregano, salt, and pepper. <br>
                            2.	Marinate the chicken: Place the chicken breasts in a shallow dish or zip-top bag and pour the marinade over them. Ensure the chicken is evenly coated with the marinade. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, or up to 4 hours for maximum flavor. <br>
                            3.	Preheat the grill: Preheat your grill to medium-high heat. If using a gas grill, preheat all burners to medium-high. If using a charcoal grill, light the coals and let them burn until they are mostly gray and covered with a thin layer of ash. <br>
                            4.	Grill the chicken: Remove the chicken from the marinade and pat dry with paper towels. Place the chicken breasts on the preheated grill and cook for 5-6 minutes per side, or until the internal temperature reaches 165°F (74°C) as measured by a meat thermometer. <br>
                            5.	Rest the chicken: Once cooked, transfer the grilled chicken breasts to a plate and let them rest for 5-10 minutes before slicing. This allows the juices to redistribute, resulting in tender and juicy chicken. <br>
                            6.	Serve and enjoy: Slice the grilled chicken and serve with your favorite sides, such as grilled vegetables, roasted potatoes, or a salad. <br>

                            •	1 beef brisket, about 3 pounds <br>
                            •	1/4 cup olive oil <br>
                            •	1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce <br>
                            •	1/4 cup soy sauce <br>
                            •	1/4 cup Dijon mustard <br>
                            <div class="hide" id="hide20">
                            •	2 tablespoons honey <br>
                            •	1 tablespoon smoked paprika <br>

                            •	1/2 teaspoon salt <br>
                            •	1/4 teaspoon black pepper <br>

                            <p>
                            STEPS<br>
                            1.	Prepare the marinade: In a medium bowl, whisk together the olive oil, Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, Dijon mustard, honey, smoked paprika, onion powder, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. <br>
                            2.	Marinate the brisket: Place the beef brisket in a shallow dish or zip-top bag and pour the marinade over it. Ensure the brisket is evenly coated with the marinade. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or up to overnight for maximum flavor. <br>
                            3.	Preheat the grill: Preheat your grill to low heat. If using a gas grill, preheat all burners to low. If using a charcoal grill, light the coals and let them burn until they are mostly gray and covered with a thin layer of ash. <br>
                            4.	Smoke the brisket: Place the marinated brisket on the preheated grill and smoke for 3-4 hours, or until the internal temperature reaches 160°F (71°C) as measured by a meat thermometer. This low and slow smoking process will ensure a tender and juicy brisket. <br>
                            5.	Wrap the brisket: Once the internal temperature reaches 160°F (71°C), wrap the brisket tightly in aluminum foil. This will help trap moisture and keep the brisket cooking evenly. <br>
                            6.	Continue cooking: Return the wrapped brisket to the grill and continue cooking for another 2-3 hours, or until the internal temperature reaches 200°F (93°C) as measured by a meat thermometer. This will allow the brisket to break down and become incredibly tender. <br>
                            7.	Rest the brisket: Once cooked, remove the brisket from the grill and let it rest for at least 30 minutes before slicing. This allows the juices to redistribute, resulting in a moist and flavorful brisket. <br>
                            8.	Serve and enjoy: Slice the barbeque beef brisket against the grain and serve with your favorite sides, such as BBQ sauce, coleslaw, and baked beans. <br>
