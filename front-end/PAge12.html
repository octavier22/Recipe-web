            <h2>Steps</h2>
            1.	Place the chicken breasts between two pieces of plastic wrap and pound them thin with a meat mallet or the bottom of a heavy pan.  <br>
            2.	In three separate shallow bowls, place the flour, beaten eggs, and panko breadcrumbs. Season the flour with garlic powder, salt, and pepper. <br>
            3.	Dredge each chicken breast in the flour, then the eggs, and finally the breadcrumbs. <br>
            4.	Heat about 1/2 inch of vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Fry the chicken breasts in batches until golden brown and crispy on both sides, about 3-4 minutes per batch. <br>
            5.	Drain the chicken breasts on paper towels and serve immediately with lemon wedges. <br>
