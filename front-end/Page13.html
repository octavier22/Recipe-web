            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <b>1. Prepare the Avocados:</b> <br>
            Cut the avocados in half, remove the pits, and scoop the flesh into a mixing bowl. <br>
            <b>2. Mash the Avocados:</b> <br>
            Use a fork to mash the avocados to your desired consistency. Some like it chunky, while others prefer it smooth. <br>
            <b>3. Add the Vegetables:</b> <br>
            Add the diced red onion, tomatoes, cilantro, and minced garlic to the mashed avocados. <br>
            <b>4. Seasoning:</b> <br>
            Squeeze the juice of one lime into the mixture. Add salt and pepper to taste. If you like some heat, add diced jalapeño. <br>
            <b>5. Mix Well:</b> <br>
            Gently mix all the ingredients until well combined. Be careful not to overmix, as guacamole is best when it has a slightly chunky texture. <br>
            <b>6. Taste and Adjust:</b> <br>
            Taste the guacamole and adjust the seasoning according to your preferences. You might need more lime juice, salt, or pepper. <br>
            <b>7. Serve:</b> <br>
            Transfer the guacamole to a serving bowl. You can garnish it with additional cilantro or a slice of lime. Serve it with tortilla chips or as a topping for tacos, nachos, or any of your favorite dishes. <br>
