            <h2>Steps</h2>
            1.	Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F (93 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with paper towels.<br>
            2.	In a shallow bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt. In a separate bowl, whisk together the milk and egg. <br>
            3.  Dredge the fish in the flour mixture, then dip in the milk mixture. <br>
            4.  Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Fry the fish in batches until golden brown and cooked through, about 3 to 4 minutes per batch. <br>
            5.	Transfer the fish to the prepared baking sheet and keep warm in the oven. <br>
            6.  To make the chips, heat the oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Fry the chips in batches until golden brown and crispy, about 5 to 7 minutes per batch. <br>
            7.	Drain the chips on paper towels and sprinkle with salt. <br>
            8.	To make the tartar sauce, whisk together all of the ingredients in a small bowl. <br>
            9.	Serve the fish and chips with tartar sauce and malt vinegar. <br>
