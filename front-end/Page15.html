            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <p>
                <b>1. Combine Dry Ingredients: </b> <br>
                In a large mixing bowl, combine the oats, coconut flakes, ground flaxseed, mini chocolate chips, and a pinch of salt if desired. <br>
                <b>2. Add Wet Ingredients: </b> <br>
                Add the peanut butter, honey (or maple syrup), and vanilla extract to the dry ingredients. <br>
                <b>3. Mix Well:</b> <br>
                Stir all the ingredients until well combined. The mixture should be sticky and hold together. <br>
                <b>4. Chill:</b><br>
                Place the mixture in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes. Chilling will make it easier to form the energy bites. <br>
                <b>5. Form Bites:</b><br>
                Once chilled, take small portions of the mixture and roll them into bite-sized balls. You can adjust the size according to your preference. <br>
                <b>6. Store:</b><br>
                Place the energy bites on a parchment-lined tray or plate and refrigerate for an additional 15-20 minutes to firm up. <br>
                <b>7. Serve:</b><br>
                Once the energy bites are firm, transfer them to an airtight container and store in the refrigerator. They are ready to be enjoyed as a quick and healthy snack! <br>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <b>1. Prepare Ingredients:</b> <br>
            Wash the cherry tomatoes and basil leaves. <br>
            If you're not using pre-shaped mozzarella balls, cut the mozzarella into bite-sized pieces. <br>
            <b>2. Assemble Skewers:</b> <br>
            Take a toothpick or small skewer and thread on a cherry tomato, followed by a basil leaf, and then a mozzarella ball. <br>
            <b>3. Repeat:</b><br>
            Repeat the process until you have as many skewers as desired. <br>
            <b>4. Arrange:</b><br>
            Arrange the caprese skewers on a serving platter or plate. <br>
            <b>5. Drizzle with Balsamic Glaze and Olive Oil:</b><br>
            Drizzle balsamic glaze and extra virgin olive oil over the skewers. The balsamic glaze adds a sweet and tangy flavor. <br>
            <b>6. Season:</b> <br>
            Sprinkle a pinch of salt and pepper over the skewers to enhance the flavors. <br>
            <b>7. Serve:</b><br>
            Serve immediately and enjoy the fresh and vibrant flavors of the classic caprese combination. <br>
